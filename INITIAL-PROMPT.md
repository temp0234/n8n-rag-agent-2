create a frontend chat interface for my n8n RAG agent @n8n-workflow.md. To be deployed on github pages. I use the cloud version of n8n. use this folder as the project directory.

features:
- aesthetic, modern chat interface with a theme of shades of blue
- mobile browser interface support
- a button that lists the available docs within the database
- button that clears chat and resets context

create, reference and edit these files as described in the global rules:

PLANNING.md
Purpose: High-level vision, architecture, constraints, tech stack, tools, etc.


TASK.md
Purpose: Tracks current tasks, backlog, and sub-tasks.
Includes: Bullet list of active work, milestones, and anything discovered mid-process.
